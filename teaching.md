## Directed Reading Programs

I have enjoyed participating as a mentor in Dartmouth's [Directed Reading Program (DRP)](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~drp/) for undergraduates. Past reading programs I have supervised include:

- Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Bayesian Computation (Spring 2023, with Daniel Carstensen)
- Bayesian Modeling and Computation (Spring 2022, with Ivy Yan)
- Nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and ergodicity (Fall 2021, with Andrew White)

If you are interested in participating in a DRP (formally or informally), feel free to write me via email [here](mailto:jonathan.t.lindbloom.gr@dartmouth.edu).
