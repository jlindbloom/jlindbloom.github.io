Here is a list of links to some miscellaneous Python packages I have developed (or are still developing).


### [gpcg](https://pypi.org/project/gpcg/)

An implementation of a conjugate gradient algorithm (GPCG) for solving bound-constrained quadratic programs.


### [tracelogdetdiag](https://pypi.org/project/tracelogdetdiag/)
Some implementations of randomized, matrix-free algorithms for estimating matrix traces, log determinants, diagonals, and diagonals of inverses.


### [rjpo](https://pypi.org/project/rjpo/)
An implementation of a reversible jump perturbation optimization (RJPO) method for sampling high-dimensional Gaussians.
